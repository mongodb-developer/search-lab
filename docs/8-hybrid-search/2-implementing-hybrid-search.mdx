# ðŸ“˜ Building the Hybrid Search Pipeline

In this section, we'll construct a hybrid search pipeline that combines the power of vector search for semantic similarity with the precision of full-text search. We'll use MongoDB's aggregation framework to create this pipeline.

## 3.1 Vector Search Stage

The first stage of our pipeline will be the vector search. This allows us to find books with synopses that are semantically similar to our query.

```javascript

{
  $vectorSearch: {
    index: "books_synopsis_vector",
    path: "embeddings",
    queryVector: [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, ...], // Your query vector here
    numCandidates: 100,
    limit: 20
  }
}
```

Let's break this down:

- `index`: The name of your vector index.
- `path`: The field containing your embeddings.
- `queryVector`: The vector representation of your search query.
- `numCandidates`: The number of initial candidates to consider.
- `limit`: The maximum number of results to return from this stage.

## 3.2 Text Search Stage

Next, we'll add a text search stage to find books based on title and author matches.

```javascript
{
  $search: {
    index: "books_text_index",
    compound: {
      should: [
        {
          text: {
            query: "your search query",
            path: "title",
            score: { boost: { value: 3 } }
          }
        },
        {
          text: {
            query: "your search query",
            path: "authors.name",
            score: { boost: { value: 2 } }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Key points:

- We're using a compound query with "should" clauses.
- We search in both `title` and `authors.name` fields.
- The `boost` values (3 for title, 2 for author) give more weight to title matches.
