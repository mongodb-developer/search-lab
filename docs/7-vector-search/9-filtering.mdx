One of the nice things about Vector Search in Atlas is its seamless integration with the MongoDB ecosystem. For instance, to do a vector search, we use an aggregation pipeline stage, and after searching, we can project, limit our data, etc. But sometimes, we want to filter _before_ running the semantic search. For that, we can use the optional `filter` property in `$vectorSearch`.

## Pre-filtering using number fields

If we want to pre-filter all books that are from 2001, we can try this (but it won't work right now):

```js
[
    {$vectorSearch: {
        queryVector: vector,
        path: "embeddings",
        numCandidates: 100,
        index: "vectorsearch",
        limit: 100,
        filter: {year: {$eq: 2001}}
    }
    }
]
```

## Pre-filtering using string fields

We can try this and it won't work as well:

```js
[
    {$vectorSearch: {
        queryVector: vector,
        path: "embeddings",
        numCandidates: 100,
        index: "vectorsearch",
        limit: 100,
        filter: {language: {$eq: "es"}}
    }
    }
]
```

The problem lies in the `vectorsearch` index, not in this code. For string fields to be pre-filtered, we need to add a mapping to those fields in our search index definition. To do that, go to MongoDB Atlas, go to your collections, and open the Search Indexes tab, as you did while [creating the indexes](/docs/vector-search/create-index).

In this case, we already have our index and we're going to edit it in the JSON editor. Just change the index by adding a mapping for the `year` field and `language` field. The index should look like:

```js
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "vector",
      "path": "embeddings",
      "numDimensions": 1536,
      "similarity": "cosine"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "year"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "language"
    }
  ]
}
```

The only difference is that we've added this part, stating that `year` and `language` should be indexed as a [filter](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/#about-the-filter-type).

```js
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "year"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "language"
    }
```

Add that new aggregation pipeline in your code (`server/src/controllers/books.ts` inside the now familiar `searchBooks` method) and when searching, you'll get semantic results written in Spanish.
