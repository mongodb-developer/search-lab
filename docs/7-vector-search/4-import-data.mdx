# üëê Import Vectorized Data

In the context of this workshop, you might not have enough time to [vectorize your own data](/docs/category/-create-vectors). Therefore, we have provided a vectorized version of the data for you to use.

The data has been pre-encoded using the [`multimodalembedding@001` model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings) from Google Cloud Vertex AI. Keep in mind that your queries will be encoded with the same provider as the data.

## Import the embeddings

To import the dataset with the pre-created embeddings, you can use the [import tool](https://mdb.link/import-library-data) that you used earlier.

Enter your connection string in the text box at the top and click **Add Embeddings**.

:::warning
This process will drop your existing `books` collection to replace it with a new one. Any existing indexes or changes to your collection will be lost.

Once the import is complete, you will see a confirmation message.
