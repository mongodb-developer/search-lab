# ðŸ“˜ The `phrase` Operator

The `phrase` operator is used to search for a group of words in a specific order. It is similar to the `match` operator, except that it will match anywhere in the text, not just at the beginning.

You can find more details on the phrase operator in the <Link to="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/phrase/">official documentation</Link>.

```js
{
  $search: {
     "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
     "phrase": {
       "query": "<search-string>",
       "path": "<field-to-search>",
       "score": <options>,
       "slop": <distance-number>
     }
  }
}
```
The usage itself is very similar to how you would use the `text` operator.

## The `slop` property

The `slop` property is used to specify how far apart the words in the phrase can be. The default value is `0`, which means that the words must be in the exact order specified in the query. If you set the value to `1`, then the words can be one word apart, and so on.
