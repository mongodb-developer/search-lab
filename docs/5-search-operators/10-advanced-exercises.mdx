## Promote shorter books

You've noticed that readers tend to prefer shorter books. Without using a large score boost, try to promote shorter books in the search results.

:::tip
Even without a score adjuster, the [`should`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/compound/#mongodb-data-should) operator will still boost the score of the documents that match it.

Choose your favorite method to build aggregation pipelines and try to solve the following exercises.

## Most available book of the month books

Build a search aggregation stage that will promote the books of the month and return the books with the most copies available first.

## Most prolific pooh author

Find out which author has written the most books that contain the word "pooh" (we're talking about the bear here) in the title or synopsis.

## Assume typos but still find the matches

Find books that match a user query, but also return books that match with a typo. These books should be returned after the books that match the query.
