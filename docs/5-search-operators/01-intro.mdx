# ðŸ“˜ Intro to Search Operators

In the previous exercise, you used a `$search` stage that looked like this one.

```js
{
    $search: {
        index: 'fulltextsearch',
        text: {
            query,
            path: ['title', 'authors.name', 'categories']
        }
    }
}
```

We've talked about the `$search` stage and the `index` property, but so far, we've only used the `text` operator in it's most simple form.

However, as you want to refine the results of your search, you'll need to use more advanced operators and even combine some of those operators to get the results you want.

In this exercise, we'll explore some of the most common operators and how to use them.
