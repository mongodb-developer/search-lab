# ðŸ¦¸ Query with facets

Now that your index is in place, you can query using it.

You will need to use the `$searchMeta` aggregation stage to query your data. You can find more about this stage and how to use it in the <Link to="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/query-syntax/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-searchMeta">Atlas Search documentation</Link>.

Now that you have an index on the `genres` and `year` fields, try creating a query that returns the number of books in each genre, for books published in the 2000s.
