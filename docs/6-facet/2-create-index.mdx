# ðŸ¦¸ Create an Index

To use faceting, you will need to create the appropriate index.

Create a new search index using the JSON editor. Use the following JSON for your index definition.

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": false,
    "fields": {
      "genres": {
        "type": "stringFacet"
      },
      "year": {
        "type": "number"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Proceed as you did in the previous exercises to create a new index.

Once the index is ready, you can proceed to the next step.
